These are academics who have completed a study based on tweets. Hmmm. Are they aware that twitter is a manipulated platform. Now that would be an interesting field of study. Or how two different people might see completely different news about an event depending on the way they consume media. When did academic researchers get so dumbed down? 

###### A few questions for Tanya Farber.

1. What do the following sources you mention in the article above have in common?

     + [Shabir Madhi - vaccinologist, Ministerial adviser](blacklist/#mac)
     + Wolfgang Preizer
     + [Stavros Nicolau](blacklist/#b4sa)

2. Do you feel you have fairly represented both sides of the story?
