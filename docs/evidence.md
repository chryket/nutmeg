## The Unmasked Truth

The health experts are divided. Some caring few are aware of the complexity and potential harms that could result from prolonged or inapproppiate mask use.

Others, who all appear to benefit greatly from the same sources of funding,   insist on mandating against all logic and reason. The recent dowgrading of early childhood development milestones are a testament to the damage that these badly considered policies continue to inflict on the most vulnerable.

### Partial List Of Studies relating to masks

This study says you have over three times the risk of contracting influenza like illness if a cloth mask is used.

  <div class="card-body">The conclusions from this Vietmanese study(2015): 
 Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.</div>

Conclusion: Wearing an N95 mask for 4 hours during HD significantly reduced PaO2 and increased respiratory adverse effects in ESRD patients.

**From the WHO: There is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals in the households or among contacts of a sick patient, or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a preventive measure.14-23 However, there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.**


 

## The Vaccines Are Not A Vaccine

Yep. Well, not unless you change the definition of a vaccine.

You can see from the waiver request that Pfizer believes that the existing reporting methods are sufficiently robust to ensure optimal pharmacovigilance and safe dispensing.

Where is the South African pharmacovigilance reporting system? The only one we can find is [SAVAERS](https://savaers.co.za/). 

The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority(SAHPRA) is mandated to ensure the

- safety
- efficacy
- quality

of all *health products*. Yet they are unable to produce any studies that should be readily available if they were doing thier job. Apparently they are  trusting pfizer, the makers of the experimental drug. Or the WHO, or even the FDA. 

It might be useful to think of pfizer as a complex financial instrument. A many headed beast, a gorgon of greed, 10 000 different corporate entities tied up in a gordian knot of legal mysteries, rather than a companhy that has any particlar individuals welfare at heart. The manual suggest swords are required to cut through knots like this.
