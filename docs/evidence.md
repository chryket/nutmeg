## The Unmasked Truth

The health experts are divided. Some caring few are aware of the complexity and potential harms that could result from prolonged or inapproppiate mask use.

Others, who all appear to benefit greatly from the same sources of funding,   insist on mandating against all logic and reason.

You can see from the waiver request that Pfizer believes that the existing reporting methods are sufficiently robust to ensure optimal pharmacovigilance and safe dispensing.

Where is the South African pharmacovigilance reporting system? The only one we can find is [SAVAERS](https://savaers.co.za/). 

The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority(SAHPRA) is mandated to ensure the

- safety
- efficacy
- quality

of all *health products*. Yet they are unable to produce any studies that should be readily available if they were doing thier job. Apparently they are  trusting pfizer, the makers of the experimental drug. Or the WHO, or even the FDA. 

It might be useful to think of pfizer as a complex financial instrument. A many headed beast, a gorgon of greed, 10 000 different corporate entities tied up in a gordian knot of legal mysteries, rather than a companhy that has any particlar individuals welfare at heart. The manual suggest swords are required to cut through knots like this.
