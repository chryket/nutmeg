## SAMA’s Position On Treatment Mandates And Certificates
### Or Advice From The Ministerial Advisory Committee Advisories 

Dr.Eatwell may be the ideal name for a homeopath, and Dr Toi is perfect for a play therapist, but the jury is still uncertain on quite how to interpret ministerial adviser and ethics professor Ames Dhai's appellation in the context of her discussion of  ethical questions raised by the novel health interventions at a [webinar][1] hosted by Discovery Health, complete with slides from the Daily Maverick. It also served as an opportunity for health care workers to remain compliant with continuing professional development requirements,  as well as other consolidated directives from the Ministerial Advisory Committee(MAC). 

The lecture was framed as a discussion about how international legal and ethical precedent and norms might inform the South African response towards vaccination mandates and travel passes, and how these new remedies, or collective benefits, might be balanced with individual, or human rights. 

At least I think that's what she was saying. There is much confusion about what these words mean, and the reluctance from government and the health industry to engage in honest dialogue to clarify these issues is hard to understand. The compliance by the business sector when confronted with anti-constitutional directives from government is another puzzler.  Maybe they rolled over so tamely when they understood the directive to be consolidated. I’m not sure I know what this means either.

Many South Africans have too much experience with pass laws and corruption, and have made it clear that they're not interested. Prof Dhai dismisses these voices as noise while admitting that judges and business are moving ahead anyway, despite existing legal impediments.

The similarity of the strategy being rolled out across the world makes it difficult to accept Prof Dhai's claims that African principles were considered in the drafting and planning of the covid 19 health intervention. The close alignment of the MAC's goals with those of Pfizer and other large  institutions raises further questions. 

Despite advocating full public participation and public debate around the rollout of “vaccines”, at no time has this been evident in the way that the government and its agencies have steamrollered legislation and regulations on an ill-prepared and vulnerable citizenry, most of whom have been scared into submission and forced to trust blindly and unquestioningly the harsh dictates of those who believe they have a right to control everyone’s life. 

The government's own documents make it  clear that public participation is the cornerstone of a democracy. [Section 8.1][2] states that those affected by a decision have a right to be involved in the decision making process. 

This contempt permeates all  strata of the  health services. There are stories from Cape Town of children being forcibly penetrated with the treatment  against their will. [The Pfizer trail only ends in 2023][3]. Liable information is given as a witness recounts how the nurse at school told him he is unhealthy and that the 'vaccine' will make him healthy.

Dhai’ s understanding of constitutional rights, like the rights to bodily integrity and freedom of opinion and the distinction between rights and values, derogable or non, is somewhat muddled and unbalanced.

In their haste and presumption to balance these rights, could MAC be exaggerating the dangers of the disease, while underestimating the dangers of their solution? Evidence on the ground is ignored, where the primary healthcare system is struggling, the informal economy is suffering and free access to a healthy environment is not accessible to many. The tragic loss of public space, gardens, squares, theaters and other infrastructure needs to be weighed too. What if there's a giant's thumb on the scale?   

"What is the purpose of limiting one's rights to bodily integrity and religious
beliefs?" she asks. Who has this kind of authority? Can belief be limited or are some things beyond belief?

Some of the professors answers are debatable, like whether or not the current vaccine  works at all, or can even legally be referred to as a vaccine, some are just repetition, some are alarming(a relentless virus that's causing havoc), some are puzzling, and some I even agree with, like the calls for mutual respect and more focus on non-covid related issues. 

She correctly claims that information needs to be provided to employers. This information about the benefits, nature and risks of the "vaccine" would be useful for smaller businesses, parents and even individuals and should be shared openly by MAC.

How would an employer get hold of a copy of the risk/benefit analysis which Prof Dhai claims evidence of risk that would allow some of the most basic human rights to be violated with impunity. A consolidated directive from Government passes this responsibility on to the employer so its not even clear if this risk benefit analysis exists. 

The professor speculates that regulations may allow for side effects like allergic reactions. The Pfizer trial documentation as well as clear signals from numerous credible sources all raise concerns that there may be numerous other things to worry about, including myocarditis, strokes, MSIS and more. Who is responsible for due diligence?  

Things get chilling when it is suggested that refusal of vaccination would require counseling and referral for further medical evaluation. Dissenting employees could be asked to  work from home or even dismissed, as long as you follow the right procedures, she says. Firing someone for declining to take part in a vaccine trial is likened to refusing access to a drunk employee.

There is mentions of patients. A recent missive regarding vaccination of children mentions clients. There is disagreement about these words too. The business unions and corporate oligarchs are not doctors and healthy children are not clients. 

The professor also refers to an argument presented by Safura Abdul Karim through the Daily Maverick. Ignore the nepotism and conflict of interest , but notice that multi drug resistant TB remains in category 2, while flu like respiratory diseases have been moved to category 1. A medico-legal gerrymandering of the commons, or more evidence of intensive and extensive planning from the MAC, and their partners. 

To weigh the omissions against the cherry-picked examples Dhai employs in her irrelevant overview of international legal precedent is beyond the scope of this writing and are discussed in a more lucid and thoughtful manner in this discussion about [vaccine hesitancy from 2020][4], published before the  novel therapy was available. 

---------------------

<small> The  South  African  Children’s  Act  (38 of   2005)  can  be  evoked  by  healthcare professionals who believe a parent’s decision not to be in the best interests of  the child, but this generally applies to clearly beneficial or  life-saving  treatment;  vaccination does not fall into either of  these categories,  making  it  impossible  to  compel a parent to have their child vaccinated. Generally, parents’ rights to refuse vaccination on behalf  of  their children should be  respected  where  the  risk  to  the  child  is  minimal.  .....  in  terms  of  its contributing to the decline of  herd immunity does not address the ethical conflicts of  the  parents  -  that  of   being  party  to  a  potentially harmful decision.

Finally Prof Dhai admits that "mandatory vaccinations are coming whether we want it or not".

Are these logical inconsistencies , or cynical delegations of authority between circular power structures? The WHO cannot be both for and against forced violation of bodily integrity at the same time. The President of South Africa, his ministers and the MAC cannot make contradictory statements without exposing one or the other as untrue.  

Stressing the importance of making reasonable efforts to engage  while  ignoring or rebuffing all requests for information raises intimations of hypocrisy.

She wraps up with a true story about how the MAC struggled to find the right word before settling on 'vaccine certificate'. There are special prizes for the compliant.  

The Q&A Section begins with orchestrated or sycophantic echos of support for more coercion. A Psychiatrist repeats the mantras of ethics, science and  'securing the  national health' to reinforce the idea that bullying is now required(mandatory?). "Nudges are going to have to come into the picture" is his preferred euphemism.

The moderator does ask some good questions. **What About Long Term Effects.** Who takes responsibility if there are side effects? The primary victims of any long term side effects will be children. 

Acting Director General DOH (Department of Health), Dr Nicholas Crisp’s  suggestion that children can consent without parental knowledge or approval drew this response from PANDA, whose recent letter to the Dept of Health in response to Circular 172 of 202 contains this relevant paragraph.

--------

<small> No  patient  can  consent  to  any  treatment  unless  the  consent  is 
informed. This entails the patient being given detailed information 
about the risks of the treatment. This means, amongst other things, 
informing the patient that the infection fatality rate for children in 
this  age  group  is  0.0027%  (1  in  50,000).   It  would,  in  our  view,  be 
rare  to  find  a  child  who  has  the  maturity  and  mental  capacity  to 
perform a risk analysis.

Dhai continues. 'If there are long term complications the program will need to pay!' It's not clear if there is or will be a compensation fund or whether it will cover more than allergic reactions, and the fact that  is even being raised is evidence enough of projected harm.

Prof admits she is not a scientist, so her discussion about natural immunity reveals other than the evidence that comes from well-controlled clinical trials. A drop of truth?

The urgency about booster shots provides further evidence of the lack of success of this approach. 

A question from anonymous about Statistics and proportion is dealt with briefly. It's a varying playground, and the impact of different vaccines is brushed aside by Dhai as she further illustrates the dangers of these circular power structures by confirming that she "only prepares advisories but in terms of implementing and instituting the roll out and making the final decisions that's the national department of health together with other state players".

Even top South Africa pediatricians give conflicting advice about the dosage and number of shots required for children. SAPA’s Professor Mignon McCulloch says children will receive double dose as part of trial. Vice President , Despina Demopoulos says she does n't know and yet others say only one will be required.

Broader and more open, honest engagement about what many of these words really mean, and questions like what, whose and who benefits and balances need to be answered. On a very minor side note, there's an image of me on one of the slides labeling me an anti vaxxer,  which gives me an uncomfortable sense that my rights in this context are not being respected either. An ethical scientist would not resort to name calling. Whether it's called hesitance, inertia  or the more traditional anti-vaxxer, science requires the courage to look at all evidence. 

Failure to do so will likely result in Nuremberg type trials at some time in the future.
