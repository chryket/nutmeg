### SAHPRA rejects human rights

The latest press release from SAHPRA refers.11 March 2022

Titled [SAHPRA clarifies the risks and benefits of the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine](https://www.sahpra.org.za/news-and-updates/sahpra-clarifies-the-risks-and-benefits-of-the-pfizer-comirnaty-vaccine/) it makes no sense when contrasted with SAPHRA'S responses in court and correspondence. 

You can read SAPHRA's response to THJ and SAVAERS here

Here's a brief extract From [Transformative Health Justice](https://thj-africa.org.za/)

SAHPRA rejects human rights in their reply to South African doctors about C19 injections.

Ignoring what our courageous medical professionals are saying means: 

1. We do NOT have a pharmacovigilance system in South Africa 
2. SAHPRA lacks both skills and capacity to make sure we are safe 
3. SAHPRA is not loyal to the public. They answer to Big Funders, with gross conflicts of interest on C19 injections and other products

###### CALL TO ACTION 

Email SAHPRAâ€™s public faces and insist that they meet with [representatives of now 100+ doctors](evidence/#caringhealthworkers) about the risk of the C19 shots.

text extract from enca news

    "i just want to highlight why SAPHRA
    says they're not available, SAPHRAa cannot
    use the information, the documents, the
    evidence provided to them by pfizer because this
    is private and confidential information
    and pfizer has not agreed for this
    information to be made to the public so
    it puts SAPHRA in a bit of a difficult
    position "
