## About That Horse Paste

TrialSite news highlighted the ever widening chasm between the media messaging and  reality on the ground by contrasting the data from the [US National Poison Data System][1] hotline with the representation of these same facts by the FDA and entertainment media, as they continue the [transition from misinformation to outright lies.][2]

According to this data, 1443 Ivermectin exposure related calls were made to the US national poison hotline from January through August 2021. All of these calls involved physician prescribed Ivermectin for human use, not the veterinary formulation. Previous years show 435 to be a more usual number for this kind of call. 

Consider that in the same time frame there has been a 2344% rise in prescriptions for Ivermectin, with prescriptions rising from 3000 per week pre-pandemic to 88000 per week in August 2021.

A categorical breakdown of the 1443 calls reveal there were:

 - 0 deaths
 - 11 major effects
 - 91 moderate effects
 - 148 minor effects
 - 754 no effect non toxic
 - 137 potentially toxic  no follow up

Only 22% of the total calls showed any material effect, with 78% of calls falling into the no problem category(or were aggregated under "not sure" or "no follow up").

Contrast these figures ,and the shrill messages about the [dangers of ivermectin][12] , with the data from the same hotline reporting hand sanitizer incidents. 

This shows a 58 % increase in calls for the same time period, with 3320 of these falling into the major, moderate, or minor categories, and 4 deaths.


This would suggest that hand sanitizer is far more dangerous than ivermectin, which  exists as an inexpensive, out of patent drug formulation [that’s treated over 4 billion people with an enviable safety record.][3]

Despite the AAPCC publishing [numerous][5] [advisories][6] warning against the dangers of hand sanitizer, somehow this message has not been portrayed with a similar urgency. 

Now further consider the dramatic improvement in outcomes in India, which the WHO has acknowledged without admitting the possible role of ivermectin,  or any of the [63 trials][4] that reveal positive attributes that certainly merit further investigation.  

Quite how the FDA gets from this to the now infamous  [“You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y’all. Stop it.” tweet][10] is hard to fathom. 
Unless the FDA is getting their news from Rachel Maddow][11, which the timestamps on the tweets would suggest.

Its worth repeating that this data originates as calls involving physician prescribed Ivermectin for human use. 

This not so subtle message , that ivermectin, a tried-and-tested drug,  should only be given to animals, 
can now be heard slavishly echoed across the corporate media.

After the National Institutes of Health(NIH) provided a non-recommendation for the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, stating that there was “insufficient evidence … to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19.”, a FOIA response showed that four members of the working group have [a financial relationship with Merck][9],  including an extraordinary potential conflict of interest involving a $155 million grant for the study of ivermectin following this non-recommendation.

Perhaps its time to ask harder questions about the connections between the media, big pharma and the various  regulatory bodies that together manage the public health system.
