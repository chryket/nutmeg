### SAHPRA rejects human rights

Extract From [Transformative Health Justice](https://thj-africa.org.za/)

SAHPRA rejects human rights in their reply to South African doctors about C19 injections.

Ignoring what our courageous medical professionals are saying means: 

1. We do NOT have a pharmacovigilance system in South Africa 
2. SAHPRA lacks both skills and capacity to make sure we are safe 
3. SAHPRA is not loyal to the public. They answer to Big Funders, with gross conflicts of interest on C19 injections and other products

### CALL TO ACTION 

Email SAHPRAâ€™s public faces and insist that they meet with representatives of now 100+ doctors about the risk of the C19 shots.
