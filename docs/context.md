### Context

Two years ago we were asked to give up our civil liberties and human rights to prevent the Health Care system from being overwhelmed. Then everybody watched bored hospital staff make tiktok videos. 

Depending on where you live, you may or may not have access to this Health Care System, and we use the term very loosely. It seems to have been taken over by administrators. 

These rights have still not been returned. The ruling parties, who understand that the constition would not allow the implementation of certain policies, have attempted to influence South African business leaders to apply these discriminatory and unlawful policies for them, and many have tamely complied. 

The courts are in a worse state of dysfunction than the health care system, and an unquestioning media speaks only for the deep pockets of big pharma, who are making money hand over fist from the misery and confusion of ordinary South Africans. The few public voices that speak against the prevailing narrative are vilified.

We'd like to try and show a different side of the story. 

There are some wonderful resources available for those who need help in pushing back against this sinister agenda which you can find [here](/friends), or you can read on for an analysis of [todays news](/#todays-news), or read our letters to some of the louder public voices while we wait for a response. 

If you would like to contribute an article or anaylsis of your own we have set up some guidelines [here](/contrib). 

We hope you enjoy.
