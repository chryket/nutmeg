Subject: SAHPRA — Do The Right Thing: Noity Boity!

Dear Noity Boity, Helen Ree s, and the rest of the public functionaries at SAPHRA.  

** What is going on over there? **

SAHPRA is an entity of the National Department of Health, created by the South African Government to ensure the health and well-being of humans and animals. 

Or at least that's what your [website](https://www.sahpra.org.za/who-we-are/) says, where we were unfortunate enough to discover this infographic that defies adjectives or expletives. 

<img src="/img/infocrime.png" class="img-fluid float-right" alt="no words" width="50%">

PLease could SAHPRA clarify the risks and benefits of the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine for us,  the foolish and ignorant public, in an open and transparent way. We grow weary of approaching the courts. 

There is much confusion and little trust. The much-marketed claim is that the novel mRNA treatment is safe and effective. SAPHRA has been mandated to validate the claims that this treatment is safe and effective.   

We refer to your recent press release above, which raises the following questions.

**Questions**

1. Why are you ignoring the signals from the [Uppsala Monitoring Centre](https://who-umc.org/) program.

2. Why are you [ignoring the signals](/evidence/#emergency-use-authorisation) from [VAERS](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)

3. What number of deaths or serious injuries would you consider acceptable before you halted the vaccine roll out?

4. Why can you not provide any evidence of the safety studies that you claim to have done in service of the South African people?

5. Why do none of you know that [Ivermectin](/evidence/#ivermectin) has been used to treat millions of people? And why do you keep suppressing alternate treatments?

6. What effect do you think the climate of fear and confusion has on the human psyche and public trust in our regulatory bodies. 

7. Do you represent the South African people or do you work for an unelected committee of special interests? 
 

There can be no informed consent without information.


Please find attached a cease and desist letter from the World Council For Health.  

We look forward to hearing your response.

Patient Regards
The Carronade Team

We have n't met but I asked your panel a couple of questions at the UN media charade which you swiftly deleted.  Just to refresh you memory, here are some of the questions I posed:

1. Why do you have a picture of one of south africa's prominent surgeons upside down on your website. I find the wicked inversion highly distasteful, somewhat juvenile, and against the principles that your 411 media watchdog organisation claims to represent.

2. How many organisations do you recieve funding from? 411,media monitoring africa, centre for analysis and behavioural change at UCT.

3. Do you think Bianca Coleman, Cape Tourism and the Daily Maverick crosses the line with these comments from a single article

    - "Surely their stupid will catch up with them in the form of a bad dose of the plague, and weed them out that way?". 
    - "your choice means you’re not qualified to participate in social and public life"
    - "endangered by the people from Planet Stupid nor the Constellation of Dumbfuckery.
    - "self-entitled naysayers of crystal-channelling dipshits


4. Is nathan geffen playing fair with Biznews and PANDA by refusing thier right of reply. Also please witness that if you follow the fact checking link provided by twitter it takes you to the Pfizer Study where it is clearly stated the trials end in 2023. see here(TODO)

5. in your 411 claim against the redlist. you make the following claims
        - the vaccine is not in trials
        - the vaccine prevents death. 
yet if i follow the links your fact checkers provide, I find myself directed to the study which clearly states that the trials ends in 2023. I am not sure how to respond to the stupidity of the second claim.      

6. This has serious consequences for the free flow of information. Is this consistent with your support for a free and independent press?

I'm sure there were a few more but I tired of being thrown out so I thought it was time to ask again. 

I'll add one more question before I go. This one is open to [Taryn Hinton Nicky Mokoena Bantse Pelle Thandi Smith and George Kalu](https://mediamonitoringafrica.org/our-people/). 
Do your funders influence what you say or do you believe that you are a fair and independent media watchdog? 

Looking forward to hearing your response. 

PLease do contact us here of you have any questions
