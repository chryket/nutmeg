Dear William Bird 

We have n't met but I asked your panel a couple of questions at the UN media charade which you swiftly deleted.  Just to refresh you memory, here are some of the questions I posed:

###### To Mia Malan:

1. Not a question but an observation from your earlier webinar
on medical harms. The question was asked of francois venter 
about the similarity between covid and aids. I see denial of 
medicine as similar. Could you explain why Bhekisisa has 
ignored the enviable safety record of ivermectin. 
Is it because the Emergency Use Authorisation can only be
maintained if there is no alternate treatment? 

2. Regarding the latest article in the bhekisisa. pfizer palpitations - please can you explain what you mean by mild myocarditis. This article from [Circulation][circ] suggests the immediate cessation .

###### William Bird

1. Why do you have a picture of one of south africa's prominent surgeons upside down on your website. I find the wicked inversion highly distasteful, somewhat juvenile, and against the principles that your 411 media watchdog organisation claims to represent.

2. How many organisations do you recieve funding from. 411, media monitring africa, centre for anaylsis and behavioural change.

3. Do you think Bianca Coleman, Cape Tourism and the Daily Maverick crosses the line with these comments from a single article

    - "Surely their stupid will catch up with them in the form of a bad dose of the plague, and weed them out that way?". 
    - "your choice means youâ€™re not qualified to participate in social and public life"
    - "endangered by the people from Planet Stupid nor the Constellation of Dumbfuckery.
    - "self-entitled naysayers of crystal-channelling dipshits


4. Is nathan geffen playing fair with Biznews and PANDA by refusing thier right of reply. Also please witness that if you follow the fact checking link provided by twitter it takes you to the Pfizer Study where it is clearly stated the trials end in 2023. see here(TODO)

5. in your 411 claim against the redlist. you make the following claims
        - the vaccine is not in trials
        - the vaccine prevents death. 
yet if i follow the links your fact checkers provide, I find myself directed to the study which clearly states that the trials ends in 2023. I am not sure how to respond to the stupidity of the second claim.      

6. This has serious consequences for the free flow of information. Is this consistent with your support for a free and independent press?

I'm sure there were a few more but I tired of being thrown out so I thought it was time to ask again. 

I'll add one more question before I go. This one is open to [Taryn Hinton Nicky Mokoena Bantse Pelle Thandi Smith and George Kalu](https://mediamonitoringafrica.org/our-people/). 
Do your funders influence what you say or do you believe that you are a fair and independent media watchdog? 

Looking forward to hearing your response
